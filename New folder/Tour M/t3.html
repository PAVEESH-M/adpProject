    Ooty officially Udagamandalam, anglicized: Ootacamund, abbreviated as Udagai is a town and municipality in the Nilgiris district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
     It is located 86 km (53 mi) northwest of Coimbatore, and is the headquarters of Nilgiris district. 
     Situated in the Nilgiri hills, it is known by the epithet "Queen of Hill Stations", and is a popular tourist destination.
    Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company in the 18th century. 
    It later served as the summer capital of Madras Presidency. The economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism and agriculture. 
    The town is connected to the plains by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.The region was earlier known as Ottakal Mandu, with Otha-Cal meaning "single stone" in Tamil, a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people and Mandu, a Toda word for "village".
    This later became Udagamandalam which was anglicised to Ootacamund by the British, with the first part of the name (Ootaca), a corruption of the local name for the region and the second part (Mand), a shortening of the local Toda word Mandu.
     The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter dated March 1821, written to the Madras Gazette by an unknown correspondent.
      Ootacamund was later shortened to Ooty. Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due to the Kurunji flower, which used to give the slopes a bluish tinge.
