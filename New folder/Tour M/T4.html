<p>Kodaikanal (Tamil: [ko'ɖaɪ'kaːnəl]) (English: ko-DYE-KAH-null) is a municipality and hill station in Dindigul district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. 
    It is situated at an altitude of 2,225 m (7,300 ft) in the Palani hills of the Western Ghats. 
    Kodaikanal was established in 1845 to serve as a refuge from the high temperatures and tropical diseases during the summer in the plains. It is a popular tourist destination and is referred to as the "Princess of Hill stations" with much of the local economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism. As per the 2011 census, the city had a population of 36,501.

    The word Kodaikanal is an amalgamation of two Tamil language words: kodai meaning "gift" and kanal meaning "forest" translating to "gift of the forest".
    The earliest references to Kodaikanal and the Palani hills are found in Tamil Sangam literature. 
    Tamil composition Kuṟuntokai, the second book of the anthology Ettuthokai, mentions the mountainous geographic region (thinai) of Kurinji. The region is associated with Hindu god Murugan and is described as a forest with lakes, waterfalls and trees like teak, bamboo and sandalwood.
    The name of the region, Kurinji, derives from the name of the famous flower Kurinji found only in the hills and the occupants of the region were tribal people whose prime occupations were hunting, honey harvesting and millet cultivation.
    The hills were populated by the Palaiyar tribal people.

    <h2>History:</h2><p>
    In 1821, a British Lieutenant, B. S. Ward, climbed up from his headquarters in the Kunnavan village to Kodaikanal to survey the area and reported of beautiful hills with a healthy climate with about 4,000 people living in well-structured villages.
     In 1834, J.C Wroughten, then revenue collector of Madura and C. R. Cotton, a member of the Madras Presidency's board of revenue, climbed up the hills from Devadanapatti.In 1836, botanist Robert Wight visited Kodaikanal and recorded his observations in the 1837 Madras Journal of Literature and Science.
     In 1852, Major J. M. Partridge of the Bombay Army built a house and was the person to settle there.[9] In 1853, only six to seven houses were there when then Governor of Madras Presidency Charles Trevelyan visited in 1860.
     In 1862, American missionary David Coit Scudder arrived.
     In 1863, acting on a suggestion of Vere Levinge, then collector of Madurai, an artificial lake was formed.
    
    In 1867, Major J. M. Partridge imported Australian eucalyptus and wattle trees and in 1872, Lt. Coaker cut a path along the steep south east facing ridge which overlooks the plains below and prepared a descriptive map the region.
     In the later half of the 19th century, it became a regular summer retreat for American missionaries and other European diplomats as a refuge from the high temperatures and tropical diseases of the plains.
