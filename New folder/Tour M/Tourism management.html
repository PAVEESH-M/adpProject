<p >The Isha Foundation is a nonprofit, spiritual organisation that was founded in 1992 near Coimbatore, 
    Tamil Nadu, India, by Sadhguru (Jagadish Vasudev). It hosts the Isha Yoga Centre, 
    which offers yoga programs under the name Isha Yoga. The foundation is run "almost entirely" by volunteers.
    According to Sadhguru, the word isha means "the formless divine".
    The Yoga Centre at the Isha Foundation was founded in 1994,and offers yoga programmes 
    under the name Isha Yoga.This customised system of yoga combines postural yoga with chanting, breathing (prāṇāyāma)and meditation.
    It does not belong to a lineage (paramparā), and its practitioners believe it to be based on the founding guru's unique insight
    Yoga classes for business leaders are intended to "introduce a sense of compassion and inclusiveness" to economics.
    A yoga course for the Indian national hockey team was conducted in 1996.Isha Foundation began conducting yoga programs in the United States in 1997and, in 1998,
     yoga classes for life-term prisoners in Tamil Nadu prisons.</p>
