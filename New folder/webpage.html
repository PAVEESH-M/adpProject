         <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems.
            It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to
            perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
            Such machines may be called AIs.Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search);
            recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa);
            autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Apple Intelligence, and AI art):
            and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI:
            "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications,
            often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.

            Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors
             (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile 
            sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.

            In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. 
            GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models,often in response to prompts.
            In March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it.
            The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. 
            Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, 
            the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.
