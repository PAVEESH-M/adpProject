<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Happy Teachers Day !</h1>

<div style="background-colour:yellow;">Teachers' Day is a unique day observed globally 
to recognise and respect the hard work of educators
who shape the minds and futures of students. 
Teachers' Day is known as a significant event in India 
,since it honours the birthday of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,
 who was the second President of India and was a highly regarded scholar
 and philosopher whose contributions to education have inspired 
generations of students. As we celebrate Teachers' Day in 2024,
it's a good time to consider the significant influence
teachers have on our lives and to 
give thanks for their steadfast commitment.</div>
