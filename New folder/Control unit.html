        <h1 align="center">CONTROL UNIT</h1>
        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
            <li>The control unit co-ordinates and controls the activities amongst the
            functional units.</li><br>
            
            <li>Control unit fetches the instructions stored in the main memory,
            identify the operations and the devices involved in it and accordingly
            generate control signals to execute the desired operations.</li><br>
            
            <li>It uses control signals or timing signals to determine when a given
            action is to take place.</li><br>
            
            <li>It controls input and output operations, data transfers between the
            processor, memory and input/output devices using timing signals.</li><br>
            
            <li>The control and the arithmetic and logic units of a computer are
            usually many times faster than other devices connected to a
            computer system. This enables them to control a number of external
            input/output devices.</li><br></ul>
