        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
            <li>The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is responsible for performing
            arithmetic operations such as add, subtract, division and
            multiplication and logical operations such as ANDing, ORing,
            Inverting etc.</li><br>
            
            <li>To perform these operations, operands from the main memory
            are brought into the high speed storage elements called
            registers of the processor.</li><br>
            
            <li>Each register can store one word of data and they are used to
            store frequently used operands.</li><br>
            
            <li>After performing operation, the result is either stored in the
            register or memory location.</li>
        </ul>
