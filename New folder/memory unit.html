        <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
            <li>The memory unit is used to store programs and data.

Usually, two types of memory devices are used to form a
memory unit: primary storage memory device and secondary
storage memory device.</li><br>

<li> The primary memory, commonly called main memory is a fast
memory used for the storage of programs and active data (the
data currently in process).</li><br>

<li>It consists of a large number of semiconductor storage cells,
each capable of storing one bit of information.</li><br>

<li>These cells are read or written by the central processing unit
in a group of fixed size called word.</li><br>

<li>The main memory is organized such that the contents of one
word, containing n bits, can be stored or retrieved in one
write or read operation, respectively.</li><br>

<li>To access data from a particular word from main memory
each word in the main memory has a distinct address. This
allows to access any word from the main memory by
specifying corresponding address.</li><br>

<li>The number of bits in each word is referred to as the word
length of the computer. Typically, the word length varies from
8 to 64 bits.</li><br>

<li>An important characteristics of a memory is an access time (the
time required to access one word). The access time for main
memory should be as small as possible. Typically, it is of the
order of 10 to 100 nanoseconds. The access time depends on
the type of memory. In randomly accessed memories (RAMs),
fixed time is required to access any word in the memory.</li><br>

<li>The main memory consists of only randomly accessed
memories. These memories are fast but they are small in
capacities and expensive. Therefore, the computer uses the
secondary storage memories such as magnetic tapes, magnetic
disks for the storage of large amount of data.</li><br>

<li>Stored program concept:<br>

According to stored-program concept, memory can contain the
program (source code), the corresponding compiled machine
code, editor program and even the compiler that generated the
machine code.</li>
