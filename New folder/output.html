            In computer architecture, output is the information that a computer or device displays, prints, or transmits to another device.

            <li>The process of communication between input devices and output devices is called input/output (I/O). 
            The central processing unit (CPU) executes the signal instructions from input and output devices, 
            allowing machines to share data. </li><br>
